libfunctrace is a small library for examining the dynamic call graph of a program.

It is a complement to ltrace and strace, tracing function calls within the program. It requires
the target program to be re-compiled in order to be traced.

libfunctrace is licensed under the BSD license (see COPYING). libfunctrace was written by
John Levon <moz@compsoc.man.ac.uk> and updated by Emanuele Aina <emanuele.aina@collabora.com>.
